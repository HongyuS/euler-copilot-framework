# Getting API Key

## Introduction

EulerCopilot command-line assistant uses API Key to verify user identity and obtain API access permissions.
Therefore, before you start using it, you need to get an API Key first.

## Important Notes

- Please keep your API Key secure and do not share it with others.
- API Key is only used for command-line assistant and DevStation desktop client, not for other purposes.
- Each user can only have one API Key. Creating a duplicate API Key will invalidate the old key.
- API Key is only displayed once when created. Please save it immediately. If the key is lost, you need to recreate it.
- If you encounter a "request too frequent" error during use, your API Key may have been used by others. Please go to the official website to refresh or revoke the API Key immediately.

## How to Get

1. Log in to the EulerCopilot web interface.
2. Click on the avatar in the upper right corner and select "API KEY".
3. Click the "New" button.
4. **Please save the API Key immediately. It is only displayed once when created. Do not share it with others.**

## Managing API Key

1. Log in to the EulerCopilot web interface.
2. Click on the avatar in the upper right corner and select "API KEY".
